Struggled to center a div, and finally got the answer after trying for 30 minutes.
I now have a better understanding of those memes where there is such a small fraction
of people who know how to center a div.

I learned about the format of the border-radius option of css. That 4 border-radius
options are altering the rounding angle for each of the corners of whatever you are
creating a class for. So if the line is border-radius: 12px 12px 12px 12px; every
single corner is being rounded to the same angle. Where as if you have 
border-radius: 12px 12px 0 0; this is only rounding the top two corners.
