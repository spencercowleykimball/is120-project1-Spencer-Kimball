**Brief Description of my project:**

My wife has a book binding hobby and she makes these as gifts for people for birthdays or baptisms.
I think she does a really good job and makes it look great. I have also seen other people's websites
that charge crazy amounts for custom bound books. This website is an initial attempt at building
a website for her start up business to create custom bound books.



**Problems I ran into:**

I used the property that we learned in HW 5 to add a notification icon onto my shopping
cart navigation button. As of right now it is a permanent 1 with a circle around it
since I don't know how to create a counter that increases as a user clicks on the 
add to cart buttons for the different products listed on the page.

I learned about the format of the border-radius option of css. That 4 border-radius
options are altering the rounding angle for each of the corners of whatever you are
creating a class for. So if the line is border-radius: 12px 12px 12px 12px; every
single corner is being rounded to the same angle. Where as if you have 
border-radius: 12px 12px 0 0; this is only rounding the top two corners.

I struggled while trying to make the checkout page and adding things to the cart. It looks like
that will include javascript or something like that. Basically anywhere on the page
that I want to get input from what the user is doing on the page can't be done using
just html and css.

This website I was hoping to be more mobile friendly with the skinnier group of cards, that they
would be stacked on top of each other instead of in-line at least for the main page.
I think my product pages may still not be very mobile friendly since those are made in-line
with each other.

I have been struggling to find where I would use id tags where it would need to be a unique tag
and therefore could only be used in one spot. Most of the tags that I have created are pretty 
versatile across the website and therefore made more sense to be used as a class instead of 
an id tag. However, I found that adding a TOP button on the bottom of the main page is a good
example of something that could use a unique tag since it will only be used in that one spot.

Another thing that I definitely need to improve on is organizing my css file and naming
my classes better. As of right now, as I am working on an html page if I want to add a different
color for text or a card, I copy and paste a different card that was close to what I wanted,
paste it and make the minor edit. This approach has made my css code long and hard to navigate.

Struggled to center a div, and finally got the answer after trying for 30 minutes.
I now have a better understanding of those memes where there is such a small fraction
of people who know how to center a div.
